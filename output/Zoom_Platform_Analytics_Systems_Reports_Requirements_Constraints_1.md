4. Event_ID must be unique for each billing event
5. License_ID must be unique for each license assignment

### 2.3 Data Type Limitations
1. **Duration_Minutes:** Non-negative integer (≥ 0)

3. **Start_Time, End_Time:** Valid timestamp format
4. **Open_Date, Close_Date:** Valid date format
5. **User_ID, Meeting_ID:** Integer or alphanumeric identifier
6. **Usage_Count:** Non-negative integer (≥ 0)

### 2.4 Dependencies
1. Attendees records depend on existing Meeting_ID and User_ID
2. Features_Usage records depend on existing Meeting_ID
3. Support_Tickets records depend on existing User_ID
4. Billing_Events records depend on existing User_ID
5. Licenses records depend on existing User_ID (Assigned_To_User_ID)

### 2.5 Referential Integrity
**Foreign Key Relationships:**
1. Meetings.Host_ID → Users.User_ID
2. Attendees.Meeting_ID → Meetings.Meeting_ID
3. Attendees.User_ID → Users.User_ID
4. Features_Usage.Meeting_ID → Meetings.Meeting_ID
5. Support_Tickets.User_ID → Users.User_ID
6. Billing_Events.User_ID → Users.User_ID
7. Licenses.Assigned_To_User_ID → Users.User_ID

### 2.6 Value Constraints
1. **Ticket_Type:** Must be from predefined list (audio issues, connectivity problems, etc.)
2. **Resolution_Status:** Must be from predefined list (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
3. **License_Type:** Must be from predefined values (Free, Basic, Pro, Business, Enterprise)
4. **Event_Type:** Must be from predefined list (subscription, upgrade, renewal, etc.)
5. **Plan_Type:** Must be from predefined values (Free, Paid)

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Operational Rules for Data Processing

#### 3.1.1 Meeting Data Processing
1. Meeting duration must be calculated as the difference between End_Time and Start_Time
2. If End_Time is null, meeting is considered ongoing
3. Meetings with duration less than 1 minute should be flagged for review
4. Maximum meeting duration should not exceed 24 hours for data quality purposes

#### 3.1.2 User Engagement Processing
1. Active users are defined as users who have hosted at least one meeting in the reporting period
2. Daily Active Users (DAU) count unique users who hosted meetings on a given day
3. Weekly Active Users (WAU) count unique users who hosted meetings in a 7-day period
4. Monthly Active Users (MAU) count unique users who hosted meetings in a 30-day period
5. Feature adoption rate is calculated as users who used a feature / total active users

#### 3.1.3 Support Ticket Processing
1. Tickets must have valid Open_Date when created
2. Resolution time is calculated from Open_Date to Close_Date
3. Only tickets with Resolution_Status = 'Closed' or 'Resolved' should have Close_Date
4. Average resolution time excludes tickets that are still open

#### 3.1.4 Revenue and License Processing
1. Revenue calculations sum all positive Amount values from billing events
2. License utilization rate = assigned licenses / total available licenses
3. Start_Date must be before End_Date for all licenses
4. Expired licenses have End_Date < current date

### 3.2 Reporting Logic

#### 3.2.1 Platform Usage & Adoption Report
1. **Total Meeting Minutes:** Sum of Duration_Minutes for all meetings in the reporting period
2. **Average Meeting Duration:** Total meeting minutes / number of meetings
3. **Active Users Count:** Count of unique Host_ID values in meetings for the period
4. **Feature Adoption Rate:** (Users who used feature / Total active users) × 100
5. **New User Sign-ups:** Count of users with Registration_Date in the reporting period

#### 3.2.2 Service Reliability & Support Report
1. **Ticket Volume by Type:** Count of tickets grouped by Ticket_Type
2. **Average Resolution Time:** Average of (Close_Date - Open_Date) for resolved tickets
3. **User-to-Ticket Ratio:** Total tickets / Total active users in the same period
4. **First-Contact Resolution Rate:** Tickets resolved without escalation / Total tickets

#### 3.2.3 Revenue and License Analysis Report
1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Sum of recurring subscription amounts per month
2. **Revenue by Plan Type:** Sum of amounts grouped by User Plan_Type
3. **License Utilization Rate:** (Assigned licenses / Total licenses) × 100
4. **Churn Rate:** Users who cancelled / Total users at period start

### 3.3 Data Transformation Guidelines

#### 3.3.1 Aggregation Rules
1. Daily metrics are aggregated from individual transaction records
2. Weekly aggregations use Monday as the start of the week
3. Monthly aggregations use calendar months
4. All time-based calculations use UTC timezone

#### 3.3.2 Data Quality Rules
1. Implement validation checks for all constraint violations
2. Flag records with missing mandatory fields
3. Alert on anomalous values (e.g., meetings longer than 12 hours)
4. Maintain audit logs for all data modifications

#### 3.3.3 Security and Access Rules
1. **Product Managers:** Full access to feature adoption and user behavior data
2. **Marketing Team:** Access to new user and plan-type data only
3. **Executives:** Aggregated view of key usage metrics with drill-down capability
4. **Support Team Leads:** Full access to all ticket data for their team
5. **Finance & Sales Teams:** Full access to revenue and license data
6. **Account Managers:** Filtered access to their assigned accounts only

#### 3.3.4 Performance Optimization Rules
1. Create indices on frequently queried columns: User_ID, Meeting_ID, Start_Time, Open_Date
2. Implement data partitioning for large tables by date ranges
3. Cache frequently accessed aggregated metrics
4. Optimize queries that span large time periods

## 4. Implementation Requirements

### 4.1 Data Validation
1. All constraints must be enforced at the database level where possible
2. Application-level validation should complement database constraints
3. Regular data quality monitoring and alerting
4. Automated testing for constraint enforcement

### 4.2 Performance Requirements
1. Dashboard load times should not exceed 5 seconds
2. Real-time metrics should update within 1 minute
3. Historical reports should complete within 30 seconds
4. System should handle concurrent user access without degradation

### 4.3 Security Requirements
1. Role-based access control implementation
2. Data anonymization for non-authorized users
3. Secure data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
4. Regular security audits and compliance checks
