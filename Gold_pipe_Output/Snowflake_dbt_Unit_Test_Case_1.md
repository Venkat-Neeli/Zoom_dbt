# Snowflake dbt Unit Test Cases for Gold Layer Fact Tables

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive unit test cases and dbt test scripts for the Gold Layer fact tables in Snowflake. The tests validate data transformations, business rules, edge cases, and error handling for the following models:

- `fact_sales`
- `fact_orders` 
- `fact_transactions`
- `go_process_audit`

## Test Strategy

The testing approach covers:

1. **Data Quality Validation**: Ensuring data integrity and completeness
2. **Business Rule Validation**: Verifying calculated fields and categorizations
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Testing null values, boundary conditions, and invalid data
4. **Performance Testing**: Validating incremental load functionality
5. **Audit Trail Testing**: Ensuring process tracking works correctly
