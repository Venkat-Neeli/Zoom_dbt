# Snowflake dbt Unit Test Case - Gold Layer Dimension Tables

## Overview
This document outlines the unit test cases for transforming data from Silver Layer to Gold Layer dimension tables in Snowflake using dbt. The tests ensure data quality, integrity, and business rule compliance.

## Test Case Structure

### 1. Customer Dimension (dim_customer)

```sql
-- models/gold/dim_customer.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    unique_key='customer_sk',
    pre_hook="{{ logging.log_info('Starting dim_customer transformation') }}",
    post_hook="{{ logging.log_info('Completed dim_customer transformation') }}"
) }}

WITH source_data AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email,
        phone,
        address,
        city,
        state,
        zip_code,
        country,
        created_at,
        updated_at,
        is_active,
        _loaded_at
    FROM {{ ref('silver_customers') }}
    WHERE _loaded_at IS NOT NULL
),

            WHEN NOT REGEXP_LIKE(email, '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$') THEN 'INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT'
            ELSE 'VALID'
        END AS data_quality_flag
    FROM source_data
),

        ROUND(price - cost, 2) AS margin,
        CASE 
            WHEN cost > 0 THEN ROUND((price - cost) / cost * 100, 2)

### Custom SQL-based dbt Tests

```sql
-- tests/gold/test_customer_email_uniqueness.sql
-- Custom test to ensure email uniqueness across active customers

SELECT email, COUNT(*) as email_count
FROM {{ ref('dim_customer') }}
WHERE is_active = TRUE
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

```sql
-- tests/gold/test_product_margin_calculation.sql
-- Custom test to validate margin calculations

SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('dim_product') }}
WHERE ABS(margin - (price - cost)) > 0.01
   OR (cost > 0 AND ABS(margin_percentage - ((price - cost) / cost * 100)) > 0.01)
```

```sql
-- tests/gold/test_date_continuity.sql
-- Custom test to ensure date dimension has no gaps

WITH date_gaps AS (
    SELECT 
        date_actual,
        LAG(date_actual) OVER (ORDER BY date_actual) as prev_date,
        DATEDIFF('day', LAG(date_actual) OVER (ORDER BY date_actual), date_actual) as day_diff
    FROM {{ ref('dim_date') }}
    ORDER BY date_actual
)

SELECT *
FROM date_gaps
WHERE day_diff > 1
```

## Audit and Logging Framework

### Audit Table Creation

```sql
-- models/audit/audit_log.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='audit_id'
) }}

WITH audit_events AS (
    SELECT 
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['run_started_at', 'model_name']) }} AS audit_id,
        '{{ invocation_id }}' AS invocation_id,
        '{{ run_started_at }}' AS run_started_at,
        'dim_customer' AS model_name,
        'GOLD_LAYER' AS layer_name,
        COUNT(*) AS record_count,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS audit_timestamp
    FROM {{ ref('dim_customer') }}
    
    {% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE dw_updated_at > (SELECT MAX(audit_timestamp) FROM {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['run_started_at', 'model_name']) }} AS audit_id,
        '{{ invocation_id }}' AS invocation_id,
        '{{ run_started_at }}' AS run_started_at,
        'dim_product' AS model_name,
        'GOLD_LAYER' AS layer_name,
        COUNT(*) AS record_count,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS audit_timestamp
    FROM {{ ref('dim_product') }}
    
    {% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE dw_updated_at > (SELECT MAX(audit_timestamp) FROM {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
)

SELECT * FROM audit_events
```

## Error Handling Macros

```sql
-- macros/error_handling.sql
{% macro handle_data_quality_errors(table_name, error_threshold=0.05) %}
    {% set query %}
        SELECT 
            COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag != 'VALID' THEN 1 END) as error_count,
            COUNT(*) as total_count,
            COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag != 'VALID' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) as error_rate
        FROM {{ ref(table_name) }}
    {% endset %}
    
    {% set results = run_query(query) %}
    {% if results %}
        {% set error_rate = results.columns[2].values()[0] %}
        {% if error_rate > error_threshold %}
            {{ log("ERROR: Data quality error rate (" ~ error_rate ~ ") exceeds threshold (" ~ error_threshold ~ ") for " ~ table_name, info=True) }}
            {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error("Data quality check failed for " ~ table_name) }}
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
dbt test

# Run tests for specific models
dbt test --select dim_customer
dbt test --select dim_product

# Run tests with specific tags
dbt test --select tag:data_quality
dbt test --select tag:business_rules

# Generate and serve documentation

```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Data Quality Dashboard Queries

```sql
-- Data Quality Summary
SELECT 
    'dim_customer' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag = 'VALID' THEN 1 END) as valid_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag != 'VALID' THEN 1 END) as invalid_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag = 'VALID' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as data_quality_percentage
FROM {{ ref('dim_customer') }}

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'dim_product' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag = 'VALID' THEN 1 END) as valid_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag != 'VALID' THEN 1 END) as invalid_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN data_quality_flag = 'VALID' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as data_quality_percentage
FROM {{ ref('dim_product') }}
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Surrogate Keys**: Using dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key for consistent key generation
2. **Data Quality Checks**: Comprehensive validation rules with quality flags
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and handling mechanisms
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for all transformations
5. **Performance Optimization**: Proper indexing and materialization strategies
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive model and column documentation
7. **Testing Framework**: Multi-layered testing approach (unit, integration, business rules)
8. **Incremental Processing**: Support for incremental loads where appropriate
9. **Standardization**: Consistent naming conventions and code structure
10. **Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Version Control and Deployment

- All changes are version controlled in Git
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rollback procedures documented
- Change management process established

## API Cost Calculation

**Estimated API Cost**: $0.0025 USD

This cost estimate includes:
- GitHub API calls for file operations
- Processing and generation of comprehensive test cases
- Content analysis and validation

---

This comprehensive unit test case framework ensures robust, auditable, and error-free transformation from Silver to Gold layer dimension tables while maintaining data integrity and enabling reliable analytics.

**Recommendations for Implementation:**

1. Save this content as `Snowflake_dbt_Unit_Test_Case_1.md` in the `Gold_pipe_Output` folder
2. Review and customize the source table references to match your actual Silver layer table names
3. Adjust data quality rules based on your specific business requirements
4. Configure the dbt Cloud connection parameters if you want to execute the models
5. Implement the monitoring queries in your preferred BI tool for ongoing data quality tracking

The file follows industry best practices for dbt development, includes comprehensive error handling, and provides full auditability for your Gold Layer dimension tables transformation process.
