## Input Workflow Summary

The input workflow consists of a Snowflake dbt Unit Test Case document that defines comprehensive test cases for customer and order data models. The workflow includes:

- **Data Models**: Customer and Order entities with defined schemas
- **Test Coverage**: Schema tests, custom SQL tests, and validation rules
- **Data Quality Checks**: Null value validation, uniqueness constraints, referential integrity
- **Business Logic Validation**: Customer-order relationships, data type consistency
- **Performance Considerations**: Materialization strategies and indexing recommendations

## Detailed Test Case Analysis

### Schema Tests

```yaml
# Customer Model Tests
tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: customer_id
  - not_null:
      column_name: customer_id
  - not_null:
      column_name: customer_name
  - accepted_values:
      column_name: customer_status
      values: ['active', 'inactive', 'pending']

# Order Model Tests
tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: order_id
  - not_null:
      column_name: order_id
  - not_null:
      column_name: customer_id
  - relationships:
      to: ref('customers')
      field: customer_id
```

### Custom SQL Tests

```sql
-- Test: Validate order amounts are positive
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('orders') }}
WHERE order_amount <= 0

-- Test: Validate customer-order relationship integrity
SELECT o.order_id
FROM {{ ref('orders') }} o
LEFT JOIN {{ ref('customers') }} c
  ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL
```
